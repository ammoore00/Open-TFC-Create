# Notable Config Changes
## TFC
- Disabled stone collapsing as the mechanics around it were unintuitive and clunky
- No torch, candle, or jackolantern burnout
- Foods takes longer to expire
- Nutrition max health scaling is less dramatic
- Dramatically reduced animal maturation times (8x for most, 4x for birds)
- Slightly reduced barrel fluid capacity to match Create capacities
- Disabled sealing and unsealing containers with redstone given that a deployer is able to do so

## Create
- Increased sails required per rpm of windmill, but also increased the power multiplier
- Decreased hunger cost of hand crank
