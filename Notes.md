# Notable Changes
## TFC
- Disabled stone collapsing - the mechanics around it were unintuitive and clunky. It was far too easy to cause a collapse you didn't realize was possible
- No torch, candle, or jackolantern burnout - no real interesting cost or investment, just tedium
- Lamps require fuel but will last forever, to avoid them being strictly worse than oth4er lighting options (lava can also go in any lamp)
- Compeltely overhauled nutrition system
- Foods takes longer to expire
- Nutrition max health scaling is less dramatic
- Thirst removed - hunger already provides a stat to keep track of, thirst was just redundant
- Dramatically reduced animal maturation times (8x for most, 4x for birds)
- Slightly reduced barrel fluid capacity to match Create capacities
- Disabled sealing and unsealing containers with redstone given that a deployer is able to do so

## Create
- Increased sails required per rpm of windmill, but also increased the power multiplier
- Decreased hunger cost of hand crank
