# Open-TFC-Create

- Integrate Create into TFC progression
- Overhauled the look of TFC to bring it closer to vanilla
- Entirely open source - all mods and texture included, as well as the pack itself, are provided under an open license

## Using Shaders

Capability for shaders is included through Rubidium and Oculus. MakeUp Ultra Fast shaders are included with the pack for those who wish to use them. MakeUp also has many optional features which can be enabled or disabled to suit your tastes and performance needs.

Any shaders can be used, however, with a little bit of tweaking. In the main folder of the shader will be a file called `block.properties`. In that file, find the configuration(s) for water and flowing_water and add the following to the list. This will enable water effects on TFC's water types.
```
tfc:fluid/flowing_spring_water tfc:fluid/flowing_river_water tfc:fluid/flowing_salt_water tfc:fluid/river_water tfc:fluid/salt_water tfc:fluid/spring_water
```
